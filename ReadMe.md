  \section DirectX12 DirectX12 Engine Framework GAME3015 A1 W2022
   

   This project includes the framework needed to build games using DirectX12. It contains a game and world scene. The game scene initializes the world and handles the DirectX12 required initializations and updates.\n
   The world scene updates and draws the scene graph. All game objects that need to be drawn and updated correctly must be attached as a child of the scene node or have a parent that is a child of the scene node.\n\n 
   @warning Not correctly attaching game objects to the scene node will result in them not being correctly drawn and updated.
    

  @note This game is made with DirectX12 \n  There are currently no player controls added to the game. It is made purely for the purposes of demonstrating the game and world created in DirectX12. Future releases will include more game engine features.\n
