This project includes the framework needed to build games using Direct\+X12. It contains a game and world scene. The game scene initializes the world and handles the Direct\+X12 required initializations and updates.~\newline
 The world scene updates and draws the scene graph. All game objects that need to be drawn and updated correctly must be attached as a child of the scene node or have a parent that is a child of the scene node.~\newline
~\newline
 \begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Not correctly attaching game objects to the scene node will result in them not being correctly drawn and updated.
\end{DoxyWarning}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This game is made with Direct\+X12 ~\newline
 There are currently no player controls added to the game. It is made purely for the purposes of demonstrating the game and world created in Direct\+X12. Future releases will include more game engine features.~\newline
